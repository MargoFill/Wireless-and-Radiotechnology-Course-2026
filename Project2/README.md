It’s widely used in applications like smart meters, asset tracking, and environmental monitoring where small data packets and long battery life are essential.
5) Sigfox Device
 	+ Manufacturer: STMicroelectronics
 	+ Link: https://www.st.com/en/wireless-connectivity/sigfox-products/products.html
 	+ Description: A Sigfox device is a low-power IoT device that communicates over the Sigfox LPWAN network to send small amounts of data over very long distances. It’s commonly used for simple monitoring and tracking applications that need years of battery life and minimal data throughput.
6) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon
 	+ Manufacturer: Minew
 	+ Link: https://www.minew.com/product-category/bluetooth-beacon/
 	+ Description: A Bluetooth beacon is a small, wireless device that transmits a signal using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. In today’s IoT ecosystem, Bluetooth® beacons or beacon devices in general, play a crucial role in enabling precise location-based services and real-time data interactions. They enhance connectivity by broadcasting signals to nearby devices, facilitating seamless data transmission, and providing an ever-connected environment.
7) Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Transceiver
 	+ Manufacturer: NXP Semiconductors
 	+ Link: https://www.nxp.com/products/wireless-connectivity/trimension-uwb:UWB-TRIMENSION
 	+ Description: A UWB transceiver is a radio component that uses ultra-wideband technology to transmit and receive signals with extremely high time precision. It’s commonly used for accurate real-time location, ranging, and secure device-to-device communication in applications like indoor positioning and access control.
8) Wi-Fi 6E Access Point
 	+ Manufacturer: Cisco Systems
 	+ Link: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/catalyst-9100ax-access-points/catalyst-wifi-6e-access-points-aag.html
 	+ Description: A Wi-Fi 6E access point is a networking device that provides wireless connectivity using the Wi-Fi 6 standard extended into the 6 GHz frequency band. It delivers higher speeds, lower interference, and more capacity by taking advantage of wider channels and less congested spectrum.
9) 5G IoT Module
