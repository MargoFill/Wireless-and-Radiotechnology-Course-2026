Filter Design for Signal Frequency Components

Task
Suggest appropriate filters to isolate the following frequency components from the input signal. You will need to decide on the filter type (Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, or Band Stop) and specify the cutoff frequency or frequencies.
Input Signal 
The input signal is a sum of sine waves with the following frequencies:
"Input Signal"=A_1⋅sin⁡(2π⋅100⋅t)+A_2⋅sin⁡(2π⋅200⋅t)+A_3⋅sin⁡(2π⋅300⋅t)+A_4⋅sin⁡(2π⋅400⋅t)
