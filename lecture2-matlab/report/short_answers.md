# Short Answers (Lecture-2)

 

## Q1

Time domain shows how signal changes over time, frequency domain shows which frequencies are present in the signal and their amplitudes. Metaphor:

Time domain -> detecting words by their shape in time

Frequency domain -> detecting a voice by its frequency 

 

## Q2

Filtering helps extract the desired signal, reduce noise, and remove unwanted frequency components. It also prepares the signal for further processing or decoding.

 

## Q3

Modulation encodes information onto a carrier wave, allowing the signal to be transmitted efficiently over long distances and shared frequency bands.

 

## Q4

The LPF was the easiest filter to design because the target frequency (500 Hz) is the lowest component in the signal. A simple cutoff between 500 Hz and 600 Hz is enough, and LPFs are generally the simplest type of filter to implement.

 

## Q5

After modulation, the new frequency components appear at:

fc − fm

fc + fm

In A3 assignmeny, they appear at 1900 Hz and 2100 Hz, meaning the new components show up around the carrier frequency.
